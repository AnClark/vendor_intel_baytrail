# OEM Variables
#
# GMIN OEM variables are set by "fastboot oem setvar" or "fastboot
# flash oemvars", and stored as EFI variables.  By default, they are
# under the loader GUID of 4a67b082-0a4c-41cf-b6c7-440b29bb8c4f
#
# The syntax supports "#-style" end of line comments
#
# Variable settings are specified as "<var> <val>".  Whitespace around
# the variable name is removed, as is trailing whitespace at the end
# of the line.  The value can otherwise contain any printable
# character and is stored as an 8-bit string in the EFI variable's
# value.  Non-printable bytes can be encoded with "%xx" URL-style
# notation.
#
# A line of the form:
#     GUID = xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
# will change the GUID used for subsequent lines.
#

# Maximum timeout to check for magic key at boot; loader GUID
